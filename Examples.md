Jazz tap is a dance form that was first developed inAfrican American communities. Jazz tap was heavilyinfluenced by jazz music, which became widely
popular in the United States in the 1920s. Tap
dancers were inspired by jazz music’s quick rhythms
and by the way jazz musicians would make up
melodies as they played. As jazz music continued todevelop in the 1930s and 1940s, jazz tap evolved withit. Because of jazz music’s influence, jazz tap quicklydeveloped into a dance form that was very different
from earlier kinds of tap dance.

The north celestial pole (NCP)—the fixed point
around which stars in the Northern Hemisphere
(including the Sun) appear to rotate—is discernible
only at night. Inspired by the navigational strategies
of some insects and birds, researchers devised a
method for locating the NCP in daytime using
skylight polarization, which occurs as atmospheric
particles scatter sunlight. A polarimetric camera
captures images of polarization patterns, which
rotate as the Sun’s position in the sky changes;
temporal variances across images can then be used to
determine an observer’s latitude and bearing relative
to the NCP.
Which choice best describes the overall structure of
the text?
A) It illustrates how most navigational tools utilize
the NCP, recounts how researchers discovered
that certain animals are able to navigate without
using the NCP, and then proposes that this
discovery could be used to avoid problems in
navigation associated with reliance on the NCP.
B) It presents a celestial-based method of
navigation, enumerates the comparative benefits
of an alternative method used by certain animals
that is based on an unrelated natural occurrence,
and then indicates how researchers assessed the
relative accuracy of the two methods.
C) It explains how the NCP is typically located,
emphasizes a key difference between how
humans and certain animals use the NCP for
navigation, and then suggests an alternative way
of using the NCP to improve existing
navigational instruments.
D) It notes an obstacle to observing an astronomical
phenomenon, mentions a navigational ability of
certain animals that inspired a solution to that
obstacle, and then explains how researchers used
an optical device to mimic that ability.

The following text is adapted from Zora Neale
Hurston’s 1921 short story “John Redding Goes to
Sea.” John is a child who lives in a town in the woods.
Perhaps ten-year-old John was puzzling to the
folk there in the Florida woods for he was an
imaginative child and fond of day-dreams. The
St. John River flowed a scarce three hundred feet
from his back door. On its banks at this point
grow numerous palms, luxuriant magnolias
and bay trees. On the bosom of the stream
float millions of delicately colored hyacinths.
[John Redding] loved to wander down to the
water’s edge, and, casting in dry twigs, watch
them sail away down stream to Jacksonville, the
sea, the wide world and [he] wanted to follow
them.
Which choice best describes the function of the
underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A) It provides an extended description of a location
that John likes to visit.
B) It reveals that some residents of John’s town are
confused by his behavior.
C) It illustrates the uniqueness of John’s
imagination compared to the imaginations
of other children.
D) It suggests that John longs to experience a larger
life outside the Florida woods. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Astronomers are confident that the star Betelgeuse
will eventually consume all the helium in its core and
explode in a supernova. They are much less
confident, however, about when this will happen,
since that depends on internal characteristics of
Betelgeuse that are largely unknown. Astrophysicist
Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues recently
investigated whether acoustic waves in the star could
be used to determine internal stellar states but
concluded that this method could not sufficiently
reveal Betelgeuse’s internal characteristics to allow its
evolutionary state to be firmly fixed.
Which choice best describes the function of the
second sentence in the overall structure of the text?
A) It describes a serious limitation of the method
used by Nance and colleagues.
B) It presents the central finding reported by Nance
and colleagues.
C) It identifies the problem that Nance and
colleagues attempted to solve but did not.
D) It explains how the work of Nance and
colleagues was received by others in the field.

Astronomer Mark Holland and colleagues examinedfour white dwarfs—small, dense remnants of past
stars—in order to determine the composition of
exoplanets that used to orbit those stars. Studying
wavelengths of light in the white dwarf atmospheres,
the team reported that traces of elements such as
lithium and sodium support the presence of
exoplanets with continental crusts similar to Earth’s.
Text 2
Past studies of white dwarf atmospheres have
concluded that certain exoplanets had continental
crusts. Geologist Keith Putirka and astronomer
Siyi Xu argue that those studies unduly emphasize
atmospheric traces of lithium and other individual
elements as signifiers of the types of rock found onEarth. The studies don’t adequately account for
different minerals made up of various ratios of those
elements, and the possibility of rock types not foundon Earth that contain those minerals.
Based on the texts, how would Putirka and Xu
(Text 2) most likely characterize the conclusion
presented in Text 1?
A) As unexpected, because it was widely believed at
the time that white dwarf exoplanets lack
continental crusts
B) As premature, because researchers have only just
begun trying to determine what kinds of crusts
white dwarf exoplanets had
C) As questionable, because it rests on an
incomplete consideration of potential sources
of the elements detected in white dwarf
atmospheres
D) As puzzling, because it’s unusual to successfully
detect lithium and sodium when analyzing
wavelengths of light in white dwarf atmospheres ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde’s
1891 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. Dorian Gray
is taking his first look at a portrait that Hallward has
painted of him.
Dorian passed listlessly in front of his picture
and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew
back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with
pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he
had recognized himself for the first time. He
stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly
conscious that Hallward was speaking to him,
but not catching the meaning of his words. The
sense of his own beauty came on him like a
revelation. He had never felt it before.
According to the text, what is true about Dorian?
A) He wants to know Hallward’s opinion of the
portrait.
B) He is delighted by what he sees in the portrait.
C) He prefers portraits to other types of paintings.
D) He is uncertain of Hallward’s talent as an artist. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Choctaw/Cherokee artist Jeffrey Gibson turns
punching bags used by boxers into art by decorating
them with beadwork and elements of Native
dressmaking. These elements include leather fringe
and jingles, the metal cones that cover the dresses
worn in the jingle dance, a women’s dance of the
Ojibwe people. Thus, Gibson combines an object
commonly associated with masculinity (a punching
bag) with art forms traditionally practiced by women
in most Native communities (beadwork and
dressmaking). In this way, he rejects the division of
male and female gender roles.
Which choice best describes Gibson’s approach to
art, as presented in the text?
A) He draws from traditional Native art forms to
create his original works.
B) He has been influenced by Native and
non-Native artists equally.
C) He finds inspiration from boxing in designing
the dresses he makes.
D) He rejects expectations about color and pattern
when incorporating beadwork.

O Pioneers! is a 1913 novel by Willa Cather. In the
novel, Cather portrays Alexandra Bergson as havinga deep emotional connection to her natural
surroundings: _______ Which quotation from O Pioneers! most effectively
illustrates the claim?
A) “She had never known before how much the
country meant to her. The chirping of the insects
down in the long grass had been like the sweetest
music. She had felt as if her heart were hiding
down there, somewhere, with the quail and the
plover and all the little wild things that croonedor buzzed in the sun. Under the long shaggy
ridges, she felt the future stirring.”
B) “Alexandra talked to the men about their crops
and to the women about their poultry. She spent
a whole day with one young farmer who had
been away at school, and who was experimentingwith a new kind of clover hay. She learned a
great deal.”
C) “Alexandra drove off alone. The rattle of her
wagon was lost in the howling of the wind, but
her lantern, held firmly between her feet, made amoving point of light along the highway, going
deeper and deeper into the dark country.”
D) “It was Alexandra who read the papers and
followed the markets, and who learned by the
mistakes of their neighbors. It was Alexandra
who could always tell about what it had cost tofatten each steer, and who could guess the weight
of a hog before it went on the scales closer thanJohn Bergson [her father] himself.” ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

The novelist Toni Morrison was the first Black
woman to work as an editor at the publishing
company Random House, from 1967 to 1983. A
scholar asserts that one of Morrison’s likely aims
during her time as an editor was to strengthen the
presence of Black writers on the list of Random
House’s published authors.

the scholar’s claim?
A) The percentage of authors published by Random
House who were Black rose in the early 1970s
and stabilized throughout the decade.
B) Black authors who were interviewed in the 1980s
and 1990s were highly likely to cite Toni
Morrison’s novels as a principal influence on
their work.
C) The novels written by Toni Morrison that
were published after 1983 sold significantly
more copies and received wider critical acclaim
than the novels she wrote that were published
before 1983.
D) Works that were edited by Toni Morrison
during her time at Random House displayed
stylistic characteristics that distinguished them
from works that were not edited by Morrison.

Archaeologist Petra Vaiglova, anthropologist
Xinyi Liu, and their colleagues investigated the
domestication of farm animals in China during the
Bronze Age (approximately 2000 to 1000 BCE). By
analyzing the chemical composition of the bones of
sheep, goats, and cattle from this era, the team
determined that wild plants made up the bulk of
sheep’s and goats’ diets, while the cattle’s diet
consisted largely of millet, a crop cultivated by
humans. The team concluded that cattle were likely
raised closer to human settlements, whereas sheep
and goats were allowed to roam farther away.
Which finding, if true, would most strongly support
the team’s conclusion?
A) Analysis of the animal bones showed that the
cattle’s diet also consisted of wheat, which
humans widely cultivated in China during the
Bronze Age.
B) Further investigation of sheep and goat bones
revealed that their diets consisted of small
portions of millet as well.
C) Cattle’s diets generally require larger amounts of
food and a greater variety of nutrients than do
sheep’s and goats’ diets.
D) The diets of sheep, goats, and cattle were found
to vary based on what the farmers in each
Bronze Age settlement could grow. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

The following text is adapted from Pam Muñoz
Ryan’s 2020 novel Mañanaland. In the village where
Max lives, there is an old fortress called La Reina.
Children in the village say that the fortress is
haunted.
For as long as he could remember, Max had
begged Papá [his father] to take him to see
La Reina and the ruins up close. He’d be a hero
among his friends if he was the first boy to cross
the haunted gates! Just because Papá didn’t
believe in ghosts didn’t mean they weren’t there.
Maybe this summer Papá would finally take him.
He was almost twelve.

The following text is from Charlotte Forten Grimké’s
1888 poem “At Newport.”
Oh, deep delight to watch the gladsome waves
Exultant leap upon the rugged rocks;
Ever repulsed, yet ever rushing on—
Filled with a life that will not know defeat;
To see the glorious hues of sky and sea.
The distant snowy sails, glide spirit like,
Into an unknown world, to feel the sweet
Enchantment of the sea thrill all the soul,
Clearing the clouded brain, making the heart
Leap joyous as it own bright, singing waves!

Believing that living in an impractical space can
heighten awareness and even improve health,
conceptual artists Madeline Gins and Shusaku
Arakawa designed an apartment building in Japan tobe more fanciful than functional. A kitchen counter
is chest-high on one side and knee-high on the other;
a ceiling has a door to nowhere. The effect is
disorienting but invigorating: after four years there,
filmmaker Nobu Yamaoka reported significant
health benefits.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) Although inhabiting a home surrounded by
fanciful features such as those designed by Gins
and Arakawa can be rejuvenating, it is
unsustainable.
B) Designing disorienting spaces like those in the
Gins and Arakawa building is the most effective
way to create a physically stimulating
environment.
C) As a filmmaker, Yamaoka has long supported
the designs of conceptual artists such as Gins
and Arakawa.
D) Although impractical, the design of the
apartment building by Gins and Arakawa may
improve the well-being of the building’s
residents. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

The following text is adapted from Lewis Carroll’s
1889 satirical novel Sylvie and Bruno. A crowd has
gathered outside a room belonging to the Warden,
an official who reports to the Lord Chancellor.
One man, who was more excited than the rest,
flung his hat high into the air, and shouted (as
well as I could make out) “Who roar for the
Sub-Warden?” Everybody roared, but whether it
was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not clearly
appear: some were shouting “Bread!” and some
“Taxes!”, but no one seemed to know what it was
they really wanted.
All this I saw from the open window of the
Warden’s breakfast-saloon, looking across the
shoulder of the Lord Chancellor.
“What can it all mean?” he kept repeating to
himself. “I never heard such shouting
before—and at this time of the morning, too!
And with such unanimity!”
Based on the text, how does the Lord Chancellor
respond to the crowd?
A) He asks about the meaning of the crowd’s
shouting, even though he claims to know what
the crowd wants.
B) He indicates a desire to speak to the crowd, even
though the crowd has asked to speak to the
Sub-Warden.
C) He expresses sympathy for the crowd’s demands,
even though the crowd’s shouting annoys him.
D) He describes the crowd as being united, even
though the crowd clearly appears otherwise.

Studying tools unearthed at a cave site on the western coast of Italy,
archaeologist Paola Villa and colleagues have determined that
prehistoric Neanderthal groups fashioned them from shells of clams
that they harvested from the seafloor while wading or diving or that
washed up on the beach. Clamshells become thin and eroded as they
wash up on the beach, while those on the seafloor are smooth and
sturdy, so the research team suspects that Neanderthals prized the tools
made with seafloor shells. However, the team also concluded that those
tools were likely more challenging to obtain, noting that ______ Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to support the
research team’s conclusion?
A) at each depth below the surface in the cave, the difference in the
numbers of tools of each type suggests that shells were easier to
collect from the beach than to harvest from the seafloor.
B) the highest number of tools were at a depth of 3–4 meters below
the surface, which suggests that the Neanderthal population at the
site was highest during the related period of time.
C) at each depth below the surface in the cave, the difference in the
numbers of tools of each type suggests that Neanderthals preferred
to use clamshells from the beach because of their durability.
D) the higher number of tools at depths of 5–6 meters below the
surface in the cave than at depths of 4–5 meters below the surface
suggests that the size of clam populations changed over time.

Perovskite solar cells convert light into electricity
more efficiently than earlier kinds of solar cells, and
manufacturing advances have recently made them
commercially attractive. One limitation of the cells,
however, has to do with their electron transport layer
(ETL), through which absorbed electrons must pass.
Often the ETL is applied through a process called
spin coating, but such ETLs are fairly inefficient
at converting input power to output power.
André Taylor and colleagues tested a novel spray
coating method for applying the ETL. The team
produced ETLs of various thicknesses and concluded
that spray coating holds promise for improving the
power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite
solar cells.
Which choice best describes data from the graph that
support Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion?
A) Both the ETL applied through spin coating and
the ETL applied through spray coating showed a
power conversion efficiency greater than 10% at
their lowest performing thickness.
B) The lowest performing ETL applied through
spray coating had a higher power conversion
efficiency than the highest performing ETL
applied through spin coating.
C) The highest performing ETL applied through
spray coating showed a power conversion
efficiency of approximately 13%, while the
highest performing ETL applied through spin
coating showed a power conversion efficiency of
approximately 11%.
D) There was a substantial difference in power
conversion efficiency between the lowest and
highest performing ETLs applied through spray
coating. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

The linguistic niche hypothesis (LNH) posits that the
exotericity of languages (how prevalent non-native
speakers are) and grammatical complexity are
inversely related, which the LNH ascribes to attrition
of complex grammatical rules as more non-native
speakers adopt the language but fail to acquire those
rules. Focusing on two characteristics that are
positive indices of grammatical complexity, fusion
(when new phonemes arise from the merger of
previously distinct ones) and informativity
(languages’ capacity for meaningful variation),
Olena Shcherbakova and colleagues conducted a
quantitative analysis for more than 1,300 languages
and claim the outcome is inconsistent with the LNH.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
Shcherbakova and colleagues’ claim?
A) Shcherbakova and colleagues’ analysis showed
a slightly negative correlation between
grammatical complexity and fusion and between
grammatical complexity and informativity.
B) Shcherbakova and colleagues’ analysis showed
a slightly negative correlation between
grammatical complexity and exotericity.
C) Shcherbakova and colleagues’ analysis showed
a slightly positive correlation between
grammatical complexity and fusion.
D) Shcherbakova and colleagues’ analysis showed a
slightly positive correlation between fusion and
exotericity and between informativity and

The following text is adapted from Ida B. Wells’s
1970 autobiography A Crusade for Justice. Mr. Watts
is a reference to George Frederic Watts, an English
painter.
[Manchester’s] art galleries are so arranged that
the name of every picture is plainly seen and one
has no need of a catalogue to pick out the name
and the artist. This is a convenience to the
general public, which other art galleries, which
shall be nameless, might copy to advantage. To

In response to concerns that some recent financial
crises were exacerbated by consumers
misunderstanding risks associated with credit cards,
loans, and other financial products, policymakers in
many countries have instituted risk-disclosure
requirements on sellers of those products. Enrique
Seira et al. investigated a variety of risk-disclosure
messages sent to thousands of credit card customers
and found that the messages had only small and
short-lived effects on behavior. Seira et al. asserted
that such effects may nevertheless be worth pursuing,
given the negligible cost of messaging.
Which choice best describes the function of the
underlined portion in the text as a whole?
A) It notes a factor that led Seira et al. to not dismiss
risk-disclosure messaging altogether despite
their evidence of its limited utility.
B) It acknowledges a type of risk-disclosure
messaging that Seira et al. may not have fully
accounted for in their study.
C) It describes a consideration that explains why
Seira et al. recommended risk-disclosure
messaging even though its effects may be small
relative to its costs.
D) It points out a circumstance that Seira et al.
conceded may make risk-disclosure messaging
more effective than their study suggests.

Text 1
When companies in the same industry propose
merging with one another, they often claim that the
merger will benefit consumers by increasing
efficiency and therefore lowering prices. Economist
Ying Fan investigated this notion in the context of
the United States newspaper market. She modeled a
hypothetical merger of Minneapolis-area newspapers
and found that subscription prices would rise
following a merger.
Text 2
Economists Dario Focarelli and Fabio Panetta have
argued that research on the effect of mergers on
prices has focused excessively on short-term effects,
which tend to be adverse for consumers. Using the
case of consumer banking in Italy, they show that
over the long term (several years, in their study), the
efficiency gains realized by merged companies do
result in economic benefits for consumers.
Based on the texts, how would Focarelli and Panetta
(Text 2) most likely respond to Fan’s findings
(Text 1)?
A) They would recommend that Fan compare the
near-term effect of a merger on subscription
prices in the Minneapolis area with the effect of a
merger in another newspaper market.
B) They would argue that over the long term the
expenses incurred by the merged newspaper
company will also increase.
C) They would encourage Fan to investigate
whether the projected effect on subscription
prices persists over an extended period.
D) They would claim that mergers have a different
effect on consumer prices in the newspaper
industry than in most other industries. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

animals. The ecologists say that strong fences could
prevent deer from eating young trees and help Pando
start thriving again.
According to the text, why are ecologists worried
about Pando?
A) It isn’t growing at the same rate it used to.
B) It isn’t producing young trees anymore.
C) It can’t grow into new areas because it is blocked

Metal Content of Plants with
and without Kanamycin
Exposure
Many plants lose their leaf color when exposed to
kanamycin, an antibiotic produced by some soil
microorganisms. Spelman College biologist
Mentewab Ayalew and her colleagues hypothesized
that plants’ response to kanamycin exposure involves
altering their uptake of metals, such as iron and zinc.
The researchers grew two groups of seedlings of the
plant Arabidopsis thaliana, half of which were
exposed to kanamycin and half of which were a
control group without exposure to kanamycin, and
measured the plants’ metal content five days after
germination.
Which choice best describes data in the graph that
support Ayalew and her colleagues’ hypothesis?
A) The control plants contained higher levels of
zinc than iron, but plants exposed to kanamycin
contained higher levels of iron than zinc.
B) Both groups of plants contained more than
200 parts per million of both iron and zinc.
C) Zinc levels were around 300 parts per million in
the control plants but nearly 400 parts per
million in the plants exposed to kanamycin.
D) The plants exposed to kanamycin showed lower
levels of iron and zinc than the control
plants did. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Average Number and Duration of Torpor Bouts
and Arousal Episodes for Alaska Marmots and
Arctic Ground Squirrels, 2008–2011
Feature Alaska marmots
Arctic ground
squirrels
torpor bouts 12 10.5
duration per bout 13.81 days 16.77 days
arousal episodes 11 9.5
duration per episode 21.2 hours 14.2 hours
When hibernating, Alaska marmots and Arctic
ground squirrels enter a state called torpor, which
minimizes the energy their bodies need to function.
Often a hibernating animal will temporarily come
out of torpor (called an arousal episode) and its
metabolic rate will rise, burning more of the precious
energy the animal needs to survive the winter. Alaska
marmots hibernate in groups and therefore burn
less energy keeping warm during these episodes
than they would if they were alone. A researcher
hypothesized that because Arctic ground squirrels
hibernate alone, they would likely exhibit longer
bouts of torpor and shorter arousal episodes than
Alaska marmots.
Which choice best describes data from the table that
support the researcher’s hypothesis?
A) The Alaska marmots’ arousal episodes lasted for
days, while the Arctic ground squirrels’ arousal
episodes lasted less than a day.
B) The Alaska marmots and the Arctic ground
squirrels both maintained torpor for several
consecutive days per bout, on average.
C) The Alaska marmots had shorter torpor bouts
and longer arousal episodes than the Arctic
ground squirrels did.
D) The Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts
than arousal episodes, but their arousal episodes
were much shorter than their torpor bouts. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Percentage ofNonhexagonal Cells in
Hives of Three Honeybee Species
■ 5-sided cells
□ 7 -sided cells
■ 8-sided cells
Honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal
(six-sided) units called cells, in which queens lay
eggs. Hexagonal cells for eggs that develop into
nonreproductive workers are smaller than those for
eggs that develop into reproductive drones, though
the size difference varies by species. Difference in cell
size results in a construction problem—it’s hard to
neatly connect sections of small cells to sections of
large cells—that worsens as the difference increases.
To fill in gaps between the sections when building a
hive, bees rely on cells that have more or fewer than
six sides. A student studying beehive structure
consults data on three species, concluding
that _______
Which choice most effectively uses data from the
graph to complete the student’s conclusion?
A) cells for worker eggs are probably closer in size
to cells for drone eggs in the hives of the
western honeybee than in the hives of the
dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee.
B) both the western honeybee and the black dwarf
honeybee probably reserve eight-sided cells for
drone eggs, while the dwarf honeybee likely
deposits drone eggs in seven-sided cells.
C) the western honeybee probably relies on many
more geometrical shapes when constructing cell
than either the dwarf honeybee or the
black dwarf honeybee does.
D) the percentage of hexagonal cells is probably
slightly lower in the hives of the western
honeybee than in the hives of the
dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee.

ALSOL is a microcredit program in Mexico that
makes small loans to female entrepreneurs who lack
the collateral and credit history to secure financing
from conventional banks. Borrowers use their
business proceeds to repay loans in equal weekly
installments and incur no penalty for missed
payments other than lack of access to larger loans.
Economists Gustavo Barboza and Sandra Trejos
analyzed ALSOL data and found that rural
borrowers, who mostly make and sell handicrafts,
miss payments more often than urban borrowers do,
partly because they sell their goods less frequently
than they could. Barboza and Trejos claim that this
behavior reflects strategic decisions that enable rural
women to increase their profits per unit sold.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
Barboza and Trejos’s claim?
A) Many marketplaces require entrepreneurs to pay
marketplace operators a fixed percentage of each
day’s proceeds in exchange for permission to sell
goods there.
B) Rural entrepreneurs can typically sell their goods
for higher prices in cities than in their home
areas, but the number of people selling
competing goods tends to be higher in cities.
C) Due to the lower costs they incur, rural
entrepreneurs tend to require smaller initial
loans than urban entrepreneurs do.
D) The cost to rural entrepreneurs to bring their
goods to towns with marketplaces is high but
largely independent of the number of goods they
bring.

Individual elephants and Arctic herbivores such
as caribou tend to have fixed geographic ranges
throughout their lifetimes, which had prompted
some researchers to speculate that the Arctic woolly
mammoth, an extinct elephantid, might have
exhibited similar behavior. Mammoth tusks grew in
sequential layers, incorporating ingested minerals
and organics, and so each ivory stratum reflects the
ratio of strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) in the local
environment; thus, the sequence of strata shows
where the animal roamed during life. Recent analysis
of the strontium ratios in the strata of one Arctic
woolly mammoth tusk in relation to the geographic
distribution of strontium ratios in the environment
shows the animal’s range begin to expand as it
reached sexual maturity, only to contract again in its
final 1.5 years.
Which choice best describes the function of the
underlined statement in the text as a whole?
A) It discusses a characteristic shared by certain
animals in order to explain why researchers
raised a possibility that turned out not to be
supported by data described later in the text.
B) It illustrates a pattern of behavior among certain
animals in order to present a theory about
exceptions to that pattern that is weakened by a
finding described later in the text.
C) It describes a similarity in the behavior of certain
animals in order to show why a method
described later in the text did not reveal whether
another animal also showed that behavior.
D) It introduces a trait shared by certain animals in
order to contextualize a hypothesis about the
origin of that trait that is advanced later in the

The following text is from Jane Austen’s 1811 novel
Sense and Sensibility. Elinor lives with her younger
sisters and her mother, Mrs. Dashwood.
Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so
effectual, possessed a strength of understanding,
and coolness of judgment, which qualified her,
though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her
mother, and enabled her frequently to
counteract, to the advantage of them all, that
eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which
must generally have led to imprudence. She had
an excellent heart;—her disposition was
affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but
she knew how to govern them: it was a
knowledge which her mother had yet to learn;
and which one of her sisters had resolved never
to be taught.
According to the text, what is true about Elinor?
A) Elinor often argues with her mother but fails to
change her mind.
B) Elinor can be overly sensitive with regard to
family matters.
C) Elinor thinks her mother is a bad role model.
D) Elinor is remarkably mature for her age.

When digging for clams, their primary food, sea
otters damage the roots of eelgrass plants growing
on the seafloor. Near Vancouver Island in Canada,
the otter population is large and well established,
yet the eelgrass meadows are healthier than those
found elsewhere off Canada’s coast. To explain
this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and
colleagues compared the Vancouver Island
meadows to meadows where otters are absent or
were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the
Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene
pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that
damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant’s rate of
sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic
diversity, which benefits the meadows’ health overall.
Which finding, if true, would most directly
undermine Foster’s hypothesis?
A) At some sites in the study, eelgrass meadows are
found near otter populations that are small and
have only recently been reintroduced.
B) At several sites not included in the study, there
are large, well-established sea otter populations
but no eelgrass meadows.
C) At several sites not included in the study,
eelgrass meadows’ health correlates negatively
with the length of residence and size of otter
populations.
D) At some sites in the study, the health of plants
unrelated to eelgrass correlates negatively with
the length of residence and size of otter
populations.

In the twentieth century, ethnographers made a
concerted effort to collect Mexican American
folklore, but they did not always agree about that
folklore’s origins. Scholars such as Aurelio Espinosa
claimed that Mexican American folklore derived
largely from the folklore of Spain, which ruled
Mexico and what is now the southwestern United
States from the sixteenth to early nineteenth
centuries. Scholars such as Américo Paredes, by
contrast, argued that while some Spanish influence is
undeniable, Mexican American folklore is mainly the
product of the ongoing interactions of various
cultures in Mexico and the United States.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
Paredes’s argument?
A) The folklore that the ethnographers collected
included several songs written in the form of a
décima, a type of poem originating in late
sixteenth-century Spain.
B) Much of the folklore that the ethnographers
collected had similar elements from region to
region.
C) Most of the folklore that the ethnographers
collected was previously unknown to scholars.
D) Most of the folklore that the ethnographers
collected consisted of corridos—ballads about
history and social life—of a clearly recent origin. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Among social animals that care for their young,
such as chickens, macaque monkeys, and humans,
newborns appear to show an innate attraction to
faces and face-like stimuli. Elisabetta Versace and
her colleagues used an image of three black dots
arranged in the shape of eyes and a nose or mouth
to test whether this trait also occurs in Testudo
tortoises, which live alone and do not engage in
parental care. They found that tortoise hatchlings
showed a significant preference for the image,
suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) face-like stimuli are likely perceived as harmless
by newborns of social species that practice
parental care but as threatening by newborns of
solitary species without parental care.
B) researchers should not assume that an innate
attraction to face-like stimuli is necessarily an
adaptation related to social interaction or
parental care.
C) researchers can assume that the attraction to
face-like stimuli that is seen in social species that
practice parental care is learned rather than
innate.
D) newly hatched Testudo tortoises show a stronger
preference for face-like stimuli than adult
Testudo tortoises do.

Aptamers—synthetic DNA or RNA molecules that
bind to target molecules—can be used to test for
foodborne bacterial pathogens, though their
specificity (the probability of returning a negative
result in the absence of the focal pathogen) in
real-world foods has been unclear. Sandeep
Somvanshi et al. fabricated test paper incorporating
aptamers targeting strain O157:H7 of the bacteria
Escherichia coli; the paper shifts from pink to purple
as the aptamers bind to target molecules. Somvanshi
et al. tested the paper in store-bought pear juice theytreated with E. coli O157:H7, other strains of E. coli, or other bacteria species. Following exposure, the
paper from the O157:H7 test was purple while
papers from the other tests were pink, suggesting
that _______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) aptamer-based tests in real-world foods are morelikely to show a high degree of specificity if the
focal pathogen is E. coli O157:H7 than if the
focal pathogen is another strain of E. coli or
another species.
B) uncertainty about the specificity of
aptamer-based tests for pathogens in real-worldfoods may be due to the similarity between
E. coli O157:H7 and other E. coli strains.
C) the specificity of the tests in a real-world food
was unaffected by the aptamers’ tendency to
bind to different strains of E. coli. D) the aptamers successfully bound to E. coli
O157:H7 and the tests displayed a high degree
of specificity in a real-world food. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

went out now, and it was almost time for the
carriage. Martha was just coming in from the
garden with the strawberries, and with more
flowers in her apron. It was a bright cool evening
in June, the golden robins sang in the elms, and
the sun was going down behind the apple-trees
at the foot of the garden. The beautiful old house

The following text is adapted from Aphra Behn’s
1689 novel The Lucky Mistake. Atlante and Rinaldo
are neighbors who have been secretly exchanging
letters through Charlot, Atlante’s sister.
[Atlante] gave this letter to Charlot; who
immediately ran into the balcony with it, where
she still found Rinaldo in a melancholy posture,
leaning his head on his hand: She showed himthe letter, but was afraid to toss it to him, for fear
it might fall to the ground; so he ran and fetched
a long cane, which he cleft at one end, and held it
while she put the letter into the cleft, and stayed
not to hear what he said to it. But never was man
so transported with joy, as he was at the reading
of this letter; it gives him new wounds; for to the
generous, nothing obliges love so much as love.

According to historian Vicki L. Ruiz, Mexican
American women made crucial contributions to the
labor movement during World War II. At the time,
food processing companies entered into contracts to
supply United States armed forces with canned
goods. Increased production quotas conferred
greater bargaining power on the companies’
employees, many of whom were Mexican American
women: employees insisted on more favorable
benefits, and employers, who were anxious to fulfill
the contracts, complied. Thus, labor activism became
a platform for Mexican American women to assert
their agency.
Which choice best describes the function of the
underlined portion in the text as a whole?
A) It elaborates on a claim about labor relations in a
particular industry made earlier in the text.
B) It offers an example of a trend in the World
War II–era economy discussed earlier in the text.
C) It notes a possible exception to the historical
narrative of labor activism sketched earlier in the

For many years, the only existing fossil evidence of
mixopterid eurypterids—an extinct family of large
aquatic arthropods known as sea scorpions and
related to modern arachnids and horseshoe
crabs—came from four species living on the
paleocontinent of Laurussia. In a discovery that
expands our understanding of the geographical
distribution of mixopterids, paleontologist Bo Wangand others have identified fossilized remains of a newmixopterid species, Terropterus xiushanensis, that
lived over 400 million years ago on the
paleocontinent of Gondwana.
According to the text, why was Wang and his
team’s discovery of the Terropterus xiushanensis
fossil significant?
A) The fossil constitutes the first evidence found
by scientists that mixopterids lived more than
400 million years ago.
B) The fossil helps establish that mixopterids are
more closely related to modern arachnids and
horseshoe crabs than previously thought.
C) The fossil helps establish a more accurate
timeline of the evolution of mixopterids on the
paleocontinents of Laurussia and Gondwana.
D) The fossil constitutes the first evidence found byscientists that mixopterids existed outside the
paleocontinent of Laurussia. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Born in 1891 to a Quechua-speaking family in the
Andes Mountains of Peru, Martín Chambi is today
considered to be one of the most renowned figures of
Latin American photography. In a paper for an art
history class, a student claims that Chambi’s
photographs have considerable ethnographic
value—in his work, Chambi was able to capture
diverse elements of Peruvian society, representing his
subjects with both dignity and authenticity.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
the student’s claim?
A) Chambi took many commissioned portraits of
wealthy Peruvians, but he also produced
hundreds of images carefully documenting the
peoples, sites, and customs of Indigenous
communities of the Andes.
B) Chambi’s photographs demonstrate a high level
of technical skill, as seen in his strategic use of
illumination to create dramatic light and shadow
contrasts.
C) During his lifetime, Chambi was known and
celebrated both within and outside his native
Peru, as his work was published in places like
Argentina, Spain, and Mexico.
D) Some of the peoples and places Chambi
photographed had long been popular subjects
for Peruvian photographers.

Researchers hypothesized that a decline in the
population of dusky sharks near the mid-Atlantic
coast of North America led to a decline in the
population of eastern oysters in the region. Dusky
sharks do not typically consume eastern oysters but
do consume cownose rays, which are the main
predators of the oysters.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
the researchers’ hypothesis?
A) Declines in the regional abundance of dusky
sharks’ prey other than cownose rays are
associated with regional declines in dusky sharkabundance.
B) Eastern oyster abundance tends to be greater inareas with both dusky sharks and cownose rays
than in areas with only dusky sharks.
C) Consumption of eastern oysters by cownose rays
in the region substantially increased before the
regional decline in dusky shark abundance
began.
D) Cownose rays have increased in regional
abundance as dusky sharks have decreased in
regional abundance. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

In the mountains of Brazil, Barbacenia tomentosa
and Barbacenia macrantha—two plants in the
Velloziaceae family—establish themselves on soilless,
nutrient-poor patches of quartzite rock. Plant
ecologists Anna Abrahão and Patricia de Britto Costa
used microscopic analysis to determine that the roots
of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha, which grow
directly into the quartzite, have clusters of fine hairs
near the root tip; further analysis indicated that these
hairs secrete both malic and citric acids. The
researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on
dissolving underlying rock with these acids, as the
process not only creates channels for continued
growth but also releases phosphates that provide the
vital nutrient phosphorus.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
the researchers’ hypothesis?
A) Other species in the Velloziaceae family are
found in terrains with more soil but have root
structures similar to those of B. tomentosa and
B. macrantha.
B) Though B. tomentosa and B. macrantha both
secrete citric and malic acids, each species
produces the acids in different proportions.
C) The roots of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha
carve new entry points into rocks even when
cracks in the surface are readily available.
D) B. tomentosa and B. macrantha thrive even when
transferred to the surfaces of rocks that do not
contain phosphates.

Many mosquito repellents contain natural
components that work by activating multiple odor
receptors on mosquitoes’ antennae. As the insects
develop resistance, new repellents are needed.
Ke Dong and her team found that EBF, a molecular
component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can
repel mosquitoes by activating just one odor
receptor—and this receptor, Or31, is present in all
mosquito species known to carry diseases. Therefore,
the researchers suggest that in developing new
repellents, it would be most useful to _______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) identify molecular components similar to EBF
that target the activation of Or31 receptors.
B) investigate alternative methods for extracting
EBF molecules from chrysanthemums.
C) verify the precise locations of Or31 and other

D) determine the maximum number of different
odor receptors that can be activated by a single

Birds of many species ingest foods containing
carotenoids, pigmented molecules that are converted
into feather coloration. Coloration tends to be
especially saturated in male birds’ feathers, and
because carotenoids also confer health benefits,
the deeply saturated colors generally serve to
communicate what is known as an honest signal of
a bird’s overall fitness to potential mates. However,
ornithologist Allison J. Shultz and others have found
that males in several species of the tanager genus
Ramphocelus use microstructures in their feathers to
manipulate light, creating the appearance of deeper
saturation without the birds necessarily having to
maintain a carotenoid-rich diet. These findings
suggest that _______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) individual male tanagers can engage in honest
signaling without relying on carotenoid
consumption.
B) feather microstructures may be less effective
than deeply saturated feathers for signaling
overall fitness.
C) scientists have yet to determine why tanagers

appearances.
D) a male tanager’s appearance may function as
a dishonest signal of the individual’s overall
fitness.

In 2007, computer scientist Luis von Ahn was
working on converting printed books into a digital
format. He found that some words were distorted
enough that digital scanners couldn’t recognize
them, but most humans could easily read them.
Based on that finding, von Ahn invented a simple
security test to keep automated “bots” out of
websites. The first version of the reCAPTCHA test
asked users to type one known word and one of the
many words scanners couldn’t recognize. Correct
answers proved the users were humans and added
data to the book-digitizing project.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the
text?
A) To discuss von Ahn’s invention of reCAPTCHAB) To explain how digital scanners work
C) To call attention to von Ahn’s book-digitizing
project

The following text is adapted from Jane Austen’s
1814 novel Mansfield Park. The speaker, Tom, is
considering staging a play at home with a group of
his friends and family.
We mean nothing but a little amusement
among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and
exercise our powers in something new. We want
no audience, no publicity. We may be trusted, I
think, in choosing some play most perfectly
unexceptionable; and I can conceive no greater
harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the
elegant written language of some respectable
author than in chattering in words of our own.

inoffensive and involve only a small number of
people
B) To clarify that the play will not be performed in
the manner Tom had originally intended

Ecologists have long wondered how thousands of
microscopic phytoplankton species can live together
near ocean surfaces competing for the same
resources. According to conventional wisdom, one
species should emerge after outcompeting the rest.
So why do so many species remain? Ecologists’ many
efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven’t
uncovered a satisfactory explanation.
Text 2
Ecologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have
connected phytoplankton’s diversity to their
microscopic size. Because these organisms are so
tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each
other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that
water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn
makes it hard for them to move around and interact
with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld’s team,
direct competition among phytoplankton probably
happens much less than previously thought.
Based on the texts, how would Behrenfeld and
colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the
“conventional wisdom” discussed in Text 1?
A) By arguing that it is based on a misconception
about phytoplankton species competing with
one another
B) By asserting that it fails to recognize that routine
replenishment of ocean nutrients prevents
competition between phytoplankton species
C) By suggesting that their own findings help clarify
how phytoplankton species are able to compete
with larger organisms
D) By recommending that more ecologists focus
their research on how competition among
phytoplankton species is increased with water

In the 1700s and 1800s, European composers
experimented with volume in their musical works.
They did so by increasing the number of musicians
playing in the orchestra. For example, in some of his
operas, German composer Richard Wagner added
more horns, trombones, and tubas to the orchestra.
With more instruments playing at the same time, theorchestra could play extremely loudly at key
moments in his operas.
According to the text, how did Richard Wagner
achieve moments of extremely high volume in his
operas?
A) By moving the performances of his operas fromoutdoor stages to indoor ones
B) By increasing the number of musicians playing
horns, trombones, and tubas in the orchestra
C) By building a concert hall whose shape would
cause sounds to echo

Poetry in Classical Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec
Empire, relies on difrasismo, or a parallel noun
construction that conventionally operates as a single
metaphor. For example, the common difrasismo in
cuauhtli in ocelotl (literally, “the eagle, the jaguar”)
signifies “warrior.” The device’s function is both
formal—providing structure to lines of verse—and
ritual: semantic relations among the two nouns and
the concept they signify can be tenuous, as in the
previous example, such that difrasismos are often
only intelligible according to the conceptual
associations observed in Aztec ceremonial culture.
Which statement about the difrasismo in cuauhtli in
ocelotl is most strongly supported by the text?
A) Its metaphorical significance derives from the
semantic equivalence of the two nouns
constituting the difrasismo.
B) Its unintelligibility may cause its formal function
within a line of verse to go unnoticed by
present-day readers.
C) Its apparent obscurity can be resolved when
considered in the proper cultural context.
D) Its frequency in Classical Nahuatl poetry
confirms its intelligibility to the Aztec audience.

Eighteenth-century economist Adam Smith is famed
for his metaphor of the invisible hand, which he
putatively used to illustrate a robust model of how
individuals produce aggregate benefits by pursuing
their own economic interests. Note “putatively”: as
Gavin Kennedy has shown, Smith deploys this
metaphor only once in his economic writings—to
make a narrow point about the then-dominant
economic theory of mercantilism—and it was largely
ignored until some twentieth-century economists
eager to secure an intellectual pedigree for their views
elevated it to a fully-fledged paradigm.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) Although Smith is famed for his metaphor of the
invisible hand, the metaphor was largely ignored
until economists in the twentieth century came
to realize that the metaphor was a robust model
that anticipated their own views.
B) Some twentieth-century economists gave Smith’s
metaphor of the invisible hand a significance it
does not have in Smith’s work, but it is
nevertheless a useful model of how individuals
produce aggregate benefits by pursuing their
own economic interests.
C) Smith’s metaphor of the invisible hand has been
interpreted as a model of how individuals acting
in their own interest produce aggregate benefits,
but it was intended as a subtle critique of the
economic theory of mercantilism.
D) The reputation of Smith’s metaphor of the
invisible hand is not due to the importance of the
metaphor in Smith’s work but rather to the
promotion of the metaphor by some later
economists for their own ends. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Approximate Rates of Speech and
Information Conveyed for Five Languages
Rate of speech Rate of information
(syllables conveyed (bits
Language per second) per second)
Serbian 7.2 39.1
Spanish 7.7 42.0
Vietnamese 5.3 42.5
Thai 4.7 33.8
Hungarian 5.9 34.6
A group of researchers working in Europe, Asia, and
Oceania conducted a study to determine how quickly
different Eurasian languages are typically spoken
(in syllables per second) and how much information
they can effectively convey (in bits per second). They
found that, although languages vary widely in the
speed at which they are spoken, the amount of
information languages can effectively convey tends
to vary much less. Thus, they claim that two
languages with very different spoken rates can
nonetheless convey the same amount of information
in a given amount of time.
Which choice best describes data from the table that
support the researchers’ claim?
A) Among the five languages in the table, Thai and
Hungarian have the lowest rates of speech and
the lowest rates of information conveyed.
B) Vietnamese conveys information at
approximately the same rate as Spanish despite
being spoken at a slower rate.
C) Among the five languages in the table, the
language that is spoken the fastest is also the
language that conveys information the fastest.
D) Serbian and Spanish are spoken at approximately
the same rate, but Serbian conveys information
faster than Spanish does. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

 Estimates of Tyrannosaurid Bite Force
Approximate bite force
Study Year Estimation method (newtons)
Cost et al. 2019 muscular and skeletal modeling 35,000–63,000
Gignac and Erickson 2017 tooth-bone interaction analysis 8,000–34,000
Meers 2002 body-mass scaling 183,000–235,000
Bates and Falkingham 2012 muscular and skeletal modeling 35,000–57,000
The largest tyrannosaurids—the family of carnivorous dinosaurs
that includes Tarbosaurus, Albertosaurus, and, most famously,
Tyrannosaurus rex—are thought to have had the strongest bites of any
land animals in Earth’s history. Determining the bite force of extinct
animals can be difficult, however, and paleontologists Paul Barrett and
Emily Rayfield have suggested that an estimate of dinosaur bite force
may be significantly influenced by the methodology used in generating
that estimate.
Which choice best describes data from the table that support Barrett
and Rayfield’s suggestion?
A) The study by Meers used body-mass scaling and produced the
lowest estimated maximum bite force, while the study by Cost et al.
used muscular and skeletal modeling and produced the highest
estimated maximum.
B) In their study, Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction
analysis to produce an estimated bite force range with a minimum
of 8,000 newtons and a maximum of 34,000 newtons.
C) The bite force estimates produced by Bates and Falkingham and by
Cost et al. were similar to each other, while the estimates produced
by Meers and by Gignac and Erickson each differed substantially
from any other estimate.
D) The estimated maximum bite force produced by Cost et al.
exceeded the estimated maximum produced by Bates and
Falkingham, even though both groups of researchers used the
same method to generate their estimates.

Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt
have argued that experiencing awe—a sensation of
reverence and wonder typically brought on by
perceiving something grand or powerful—can enable
us to feel more connected to others and thereby
inspire us to act more altruistically. Keltner, along
with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims
to have found evidence for this effect in a recent
study where participants were asked to either gaze up
at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported
to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare
at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building.
After one minute, an experimenter deliberately
spilled a box of pens nearby.
Which finding from the researchers’ study, if true,
would most strongly support their claim?
A) Participants who had been looking at the trees
helped the experimenter pick up significantly
more pens than did participants who had been
looking at the building.
B) Participants who helped the experimenter pick
up the pens used a greater number of positive
words to describe the trees and the building in a
postexperiment survey than did participants who
did not help the experimenter.
C) Participants who did not help the experimenter
pick up the pens were significantly more likely to
report having experienced a feeling of awe,
regardless of whether they looked at the building
or the trees.
D) Participants who had been looking at the
building were significantly more likely to notice
that the experimenter had dropped the pens than
were participants who had been looking at the
trees.

The domestic sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas)
descends from a wild plant native to South America.
It also populates the Polynesian Islands, where
evidence confirms that Native Hawaiians and other
Indigenous peoples were cultivating the plant
centuries before seafaring first occurred over the
thousands of miles of ocean separating them fromSouth America. To explain how the sweet potato
was first introduced in Polynesia, botanist Pablo
Muñoz-Rodríguez and colleagues analyzed the DNAof numerous varieties of the plant, concluding that
Polynesian varieties diverged from South Americanones over 100,000 years ago. Given that Polynesia
was peopled only in the last three thousand years, theteam concluded that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) the cultivation of the sweet potato in Polynesia

B) Polynesian peoples likely acquired the sweet
potato from South American peoples only withinthe last three thousand years.

introduction of the sweet potato in Polynesia.
D) Polynesian sweet potato varieties likely descendfrom a single South American variety that was
domesticated, not wild. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

The morphological novelty of echinoderms—marine
invertebrates with radial symmetry, usually starlike,
around a central point—impedes comparisons with
most other animals, in which bilateral symmetry on
an anterior-posterior (head to tail) axis through a
trunk is typical. Particularly puzzling are sea stars,
thought to have evolved a headless layout from a
known bilateral origin. Applying genomic knowledge
of Saccoglossus kowalevskii acorn worms (close
relatives of sea stars, and thus expected to have
similar markers for corresponding anatomical
regions) to the body patterning genes of Patiria
miniata sea stars, Laurent Formery et al. observed
activity only in anterior genes across P. miniata’s
entire body and some posterior genes limited to the
edges, suggesting that _______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) despite the greater prevalence of anterior genes
in sea stars’ genetic makeup, posterior genes
active at the body’s perimeter are primarily
responsible for the starlike layout that
distinguishes sea stars’ radial symmetry from
that of other echinoderms.
B) contrary to the belief that they evolved from
early ancestors with the bilateral form typical of
many other animals, sea stars instead originated
with an atypical body layout that was neither
bilaterally nor radially symmetrical.
C) although the two species are closely related, there
is only minimal correspondence in the genetic
markers for head, tail, and trunk region
development in P. miniata sea stars and
S. kowalevskii acorn worms.
D) rather than undergoing changes resulting in the
eventual elimination of a head region in their
radial body plan, as previously assumed, sea
stars’ morphology evolved to completely lack a
trunk and consist primarily of a head region.
