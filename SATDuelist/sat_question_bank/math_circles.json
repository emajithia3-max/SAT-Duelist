      "skill": "Apply properties of circles to find arc length or area",
      "question": "A circle has a radius of 6. What is the area of a sector with a central angle of 60°?",
      "correct_answer": "6π",
      "wrong_answers": ["36π", "12π", "2π"],
      "explanation": "Sector area = (θ/360°) × πr² = (60/360) × π(6)² = (1/6) × 36π = 6π. The sector is 1/6 of the full circle since 60° is 1/6 of 360°."
