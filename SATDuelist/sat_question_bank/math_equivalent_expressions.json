      "skill": "Factor and expand polynomial expressions",
      "question": "Which of the following is equivalent to (x + 3)(x - 3) + 6x?",
      "correct_answer": "x² + 6x - 9",
      "wrong_answers": ["x² - 9", "x² + 6x + 9", "x² - 6x - 9"],
      "explanation": "First expand (x + 3)(x - 3) using the difference of squares: x² - 9. Then add 6x: x² - 9 + 6x = x² + 6x - 9. The common error is forgetting to add the 6x term."
