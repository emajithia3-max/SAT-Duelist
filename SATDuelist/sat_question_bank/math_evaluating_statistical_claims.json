      "skill": "Identify limitations of statistical studies",
      "question": "A company surveys its own employees about job satisfaction and reports that 90% are satisfied. What is the main limitation of using this result to claim that most workers in the industry are satisfied?",
      "correct_answer": "The sample only includes employees from one company and may not represent the industry",
      "wrong_answers": ["The sample size is too small to draw any conclusions", "Job satisfaction cannot be measured accurately through surveys", "The percentage should have been higher to make a valid claim"],
      "explanation": "The main issue is sampling bias. Surveying only one company's employees does not provide a representative sample of the entire industry. Different companies may have different satisfaction levels."
