      "question": "A phone plan charges a monthly fee plus a rate per gigabyte of data used. The equation C = 25 + 10d represents the total monthly cost C, in dollars, for using d gigabytes of data. What does the 25 represent in this equation?",
      "correct_answer": "The fixed monthly fee in dollars",
      "wrong_answers": ["The cost per gigabyte of data", "The total number of gigabytes included", "The maximum monthly cost"],
      "explanation": "In the equation C = 25 + 10d, the constant 25 is the y-intercept, representing the cost when d = 0 (no data used). This is the fixed monthly fee. The 10 is the slope, representing the cost per gigabyte."
