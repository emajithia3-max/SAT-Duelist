      "id": "math_le2v_001",
      "question_type": "multiple_choice",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "skill": "Interpret slope and y-intercept in context",
      "question": "A phone plan charges a monthly fee plus a rate per gigabyte of data used. The equation C = 25 + 10d represents the total monthly cost C, in dollars, for using d gigabytes of data. What does the 25 represent in this equation?",
      "correct_answer": "The fixed monthly fee in dollars",
      "wrong_answers": ["The cost per gigabyte of data", "The total number of gigabytes included", "The maximum monthly cost"],
      "explanation": "In the equation C = 25 + 10d, the constant 25 is the y-intercept, representing the cost when d = 0 (no data used). This is the fixed monthly fee."

      "correct_answer": "3",
      "wrong_answers": ["5", "-3", "1/3"],
      "explanation": "In slope-intercept form y = mx + b, m is the slope. Here m = 3."

      "correct_answer": "7",
      "wrong_answers": ["-2", "0", "-7"],
      "explanation": "In y = mx + b, the y-intercept is b. Here b = 7."

      "correct_answer": "3",
      "wrong_answers": ["-3", "9", "-9"],
      "explanation": "At x-intercept, y = 0. So 0 = 3x - 9, giving 3x = 9 and x = 3."
