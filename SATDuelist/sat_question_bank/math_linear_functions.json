      "question_type": "multiple_choice",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "skill": "Determine the equation of a line given two points",
      "question": "A line passes through the points (2, 5) and (6, 13). What is the equation of this line in slope-intercept form?",
      "correct_answer": "y = 2x + 1",
      "wrong_answers": ["y = 2x + 5", "y = 4x - 3", "y = x + 3"],
      "explanation": "First find the slope: m = (13 - 5)/(6 - 2) = 8/4 = 2. Then use point-slope form with (2, 5): y - 5 = 2(x - 2), which gives y = 2x - 4 + 5 = 2x + 1."
