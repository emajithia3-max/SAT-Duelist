      "skill": "Determine the equation of a line given two points",
      "question": "A line passes through the points (2, 5) and (6, 13). What is the equation of this line in slope-intercept form?",
      "correct_answer": "y = 2x + 1",
      "wrong_answers": ["y = 2x + 5", "y = 4x - 3", "y = x + 3"],
      "explanation": "Slope = (13 - 5)/(6 - 2) = 8/4 = 2. Using point-slope form: y - 5 = 2(x - 2), giving y = 2x + 1."
