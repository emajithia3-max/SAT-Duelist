      "question": "A student has at most $50 to spend on books and supplies. Books cost $8 each and supplies cost $2 each. If the student buys 4 books, what is the maximum number of supplies they can buy?",
      "correct_answer": "9",
      "wrong_answers": ["10", "8", "18"],
      "explanation": "Set up the inequality: 8(4) + 2s ≤ 50, where s is the number of supplies. This gives 32 + 2s ≤ 50, so 2s ≤ 18, meaning s ≤ 9. The maximum number of supplies is 9."
