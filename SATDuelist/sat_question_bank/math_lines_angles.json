      "difficulty": "easy",
      "skill": "Apply properties of parallel lines and transversals",
      "question": "Two parallel lines are cut by a transversal. One of the angles formed measures 65°. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?",
      "correct_answer": "65°",
      "wrong_answers": ["115°", "25°", "90°"],
      "explanation": "When parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, the corresponding angle also measures 65°. Supplementary angles would be 115°, which is a common distractor."
