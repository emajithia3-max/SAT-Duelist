      "id": "math_nlf_001",
      "question_type": "multiple_choice",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "skill": "Identify properties of quadratic functions from their graphs or equations",
      "question": "The function f(x) = (x - 4)² - 9 is graphed in the xy-plane. What is the minimum value of f(x)?",
      "correct_answer": "-9",
      "wrong_answers": ["4", "9", "-4"],
      "explanation": "The function is in vertex form f(x) = (x - h)² + k, where the vertex is (h, k). Here, the vertex is (4, -9). Since the coefficient of (x - 4)² is positive, the parabola opens upward, so the minimum value is -9."
