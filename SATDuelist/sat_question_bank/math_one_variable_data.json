      "question": "The ages of five employees are 24, 28, 31, 31, and 36. What is the mean age of these employees?",
      "correct_answer": "30",
      "wrong_answers": ["28", "31", "32"],
      "explanation": "Mean = sum of values / number of values = (24 + 28 + 31 + 31 + 36) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30. Note that the median would be 31 (the middle value), which is a common distractor."
