      "question": "A bag contains 4 red marbles, 6 blue marbles, and 5 green marbles. If one marble is selected at random, what is the probability that it is blue?",
      "correct_answer": "2/5",
      "wrong_answers": ["6/15", "1/3", "6/9"],
      "explanation": "Total marbles = 4 + 6 + 5 = 15. Probability of blue = 6/15 = 2/5. Note that 6/15 simplifies to 2/5, so the answer must be in simplified form."
