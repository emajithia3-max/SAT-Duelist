      "question": "A recipe calls for flour and sugar in a ratio of 3:2. If a baker uses 12 cups of flour, how many cups of sugar should be used?",
      "correct_answer": "8",
      "wrong_answers": ["6", "10", "18"],
      "explanation": "The ratio 3:2 means for every 3 parts flour, there are 2 parts sugar. If flour = 12 cups, then 12 ÷ 3 = 4 parts. Sugar = 4 × 2 = 8 cups. Alternatively: 3/2 = 12/x, so x = 8."
