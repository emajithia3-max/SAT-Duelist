      "question_type": "multiple_choice",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "skill": "Apply trigonometric ratios to find missing sides",
      "question": "In a right triangle, one of the acute angles measures 30°. If the side opposite this angle has length 5, what is the length of the hypotenuse?",
      "correct_answer": "10",
      "wrong_answers": ["5√3", "5/2", "2.5"],
      "explanation": "Using sin(30°) = opposite/hypotenuse: sin(30°) = 5/hypotenuse. Since sin(30°) = 1/2, we have 1/2 = 5/hypotenuse, so hypotenuse = 10."
