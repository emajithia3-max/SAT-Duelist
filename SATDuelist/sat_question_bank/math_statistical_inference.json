      "difficulty": "hard",
      "skill": "Draw conclusions from sample data about a population",
      "question": "A researcher surveys 500 randomly selected voters in a city and finds that 280 support a new policy. Which of the following is the best estimate of the percentage of all voters in the city who support the policy?",
      "correct_answer": "56%",
      "wrong_answers": ["28%", "50%", "72%"],
      "explanation": "The sample proportion is 280/500 = 0.56 = 56%. Since the sample is random, this proportion is the best estimate of the population proportion. The key is recognizing that random sampling allows inference to the population."
