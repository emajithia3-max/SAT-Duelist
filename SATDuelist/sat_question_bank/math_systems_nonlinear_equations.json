      "skill": "Solve systems involving quadratic and linear equations",
      "question": "The graphs of y = x² and y = x + 6 intersect at two points. What is the x-coordinate of the intersection point where x is positive?",
      "correct_answer": "3",
      "wrong_answers": [],
      "explanation": "Set the equations equal: x² = x + 6. Rearrange: x² - x - 6 = 0. Factor: (x - 3)(x + 2) = 0. Solutions are x = 3 and x = -2. The positive x-coordinate is 3."
