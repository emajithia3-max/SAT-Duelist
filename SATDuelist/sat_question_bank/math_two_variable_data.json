      "skill": "Interpret scatterplots and lines of best fit",
      "question": "A scatterplot shows the relationship between hours studied (x) and test scores (y). The line of best fit is y = 5x + 60. According to this model, what is the predicted test score for a student who studies for 6 hours?",
      "correct_answer": "90",
      "wrong_answers": ["65", "66", "85"],
      "explanation": "Substitute x = 6 into the equation: y = 5(6) + 60 = 30 + 60 = 90. The model predicts a test score of 90 for 6 hours of studying."
