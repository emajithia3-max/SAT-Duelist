      "difficulty": "medium",
      "skill": "Select evidence that best supports a claim",
      "question": "A researcher claims that employee productivity increases when workers are given more autonomy over their schedules. Which finding, if true, would most directly support this claim?",
      "correct_answer": "Companies that implemented flexible scheduling saw a 23% increase in output per employee",
      "wrong_answers": ["Most employees prefer to work from home rather than in an office", "Productivity studies are often conducted in controlled laboratory settings", "Employee satisfaction surveys show workers value competitive salaries"],
      "explanation": "The claim is specifically about autonomy over schedules increasing productivity. The correct answer directly links flexible scheduling (autonomy) to increased output (productivity). Work-from-home preferences, study methodology, and salary preferences don't directly address schedule autonomy and productivity."
