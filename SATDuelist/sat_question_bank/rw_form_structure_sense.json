      "question_type": "multiple_choice",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "skill": "Ensure subject-verb agreement in complex sentences",
      "question": "The collection of rare manuscripts, along with several first-edition books, _______ recently been acquired by the university library.\n\nWhich choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?",
      "correct_answer": "has",
      "wrong_answers": ["have", "are having", "were"],
      "explanation": "The subject is 'collection' (singular), not 'manuscripts' or 'books.' The phrase 'along with several first-edition books' is a parenthetical addition and does not change the number of the subject. A singular subject requires a singular verb: 'has.'"
