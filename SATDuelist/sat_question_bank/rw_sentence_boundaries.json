      "question_type": "multiple_choice",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "skill": "Correctly punctuate to avoid run-on sentences and fragments",
      "question": "The museum's new exhibit on ancient Egypt has attracted visitors from around the world _______ historians and archaeologists have praised its accuracy and educational value.\n\nWhich choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?",
      "correct_answer": "; both",
      "wrong_answers": [", both", "both", ": both"],
      "explanation": "Two independent clauses need proper punctuation. A semicolon correctly joins them when followed by a transitional word. A comma before 'both' creates a comma splice. 'Both' alone creates a run-on. A colon is used to introduce a list or explanation, not to join independent clauses of equal weight."
