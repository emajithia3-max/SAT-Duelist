      "question": "The new software promised to increase efficiency by automating routine tasks. _______, many employees found that they spent more time troubleshooting errors than they had saved.\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical transition?",
      "correct_answer": "However",
      "wrong_answers": ["Therefore", "Similarly", "Furthermore"],
      "explanation": "The second sentence presents a contrasting outcome to the promise in the first sentence. 'However' signals contrast.
